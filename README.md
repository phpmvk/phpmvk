### Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

Hey there! I'm Philip, a passionate developer based in Barcelona. Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I collaborate, code, and build some of my projects.

#### Highlights

🎯 Currently, I'm dedicated to the development of an exciting project called [YouCoder](https://youcoder.io). YouCoder is a cutting-edge application that enables users to effortlessly record, replay, and share their keystrokes within an integrated development environment (IDE). As the backend developer, I designed and implemented the entire backend architecture. This includes an Express server that seamlessly connects to a PostgreSQL database hosted by Supabase, all written in TypeScript. To ensure code quality, I employ Jest to run comprehensive test suites, and Docker simplifies the sharing of the backend in the deployed version. YouCoder is a live project, and I handle the deployment of both the frontend (using Netlify) and the backend (using fly.io).

🚀 I have developed an app called [RentalGenie](https://github.com/phpmvk/RentalGenie). This application was built using Angular, RxJS, Firebase, and TypeScript on the frontend, while the backend leverages Node.JS with an Express server. The app seamlessly connects to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose ODM and integrates the Open API, enhancing its functionality and versatility. Please feel free to fork my repo and make changes!

💡 I'm proud to have contributed to the open-source project [TravelPlanner](https://github.com/GuillaumeRcd/TravelPlanner). I refactored the codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript, enhancing the project's maintainability and scalability. Additionally, I implemented a comprehensive suite of tests for both the frontend and the backend, ensuring robustness and reliability.

#### Open Source

🌍 I actively seek opportunities to contribute to the tech community and collaborate with like-minded individuals on exciting initiatives, which is why I really enjoy it when I can actually make meaningful contributions to open source projects.

#### Seeking Full-Stack Developer Roles

🔎 I am currently seeking full-stack developer roles that challenge me and provide opportunities for growth. I'm excited about working on cutting-edge technologies and delivering high-quality solutions that make a positive impact.

#### Get in Touch

📬 I'm always open to connecting with fellow developers, exploring new collaborations, or discussing anything related to technology. Please feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:phpmvk@gmail.com).
