#### Highlights

🎯 Currently, I'm dedicated to the development of an exciting app called [YouCoder](https://youcoder.io). YouCoder is a cutting-edge application that enables users to effortlessly record, replay, and share their keystrokes within an integrated development environment (IDE). As a full stack developer in the team, I designed and  implemented the entire backend architecture, and was highly involved in the planning stages for frontend component logic. I put together an Express server that seamlessly connects to a PostgreSQL database hosted by Supabase, all written in TypeScript. To ensure code quality, I employ Jest to run comprehensive test suites, and Docker simplifies the sharing of the backend in the deployed version. YouCoder is a live project, and I am responsible for the deployment of both the frontend (using Netlify) and the backend (using fly.io).

🚀 I have developed an app called [RentalGenie](https://github.com/phpmvk/RentalGenie). This application was built using Angular, RxJS, Firebase, and TypeScript on the frontend, while the backend leverages Node.JS with an Express server. The app seamlessly connects to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose ODM and integrates the OpenAI API, enhancing its functionality and versatility. Please feel free to fork my repo and make changes!

💡 I'm proud to have contributed to the open-source project [TravelPlanner](https://github.com/GuillaumeRcd/TravelPlanner). I refactored the codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript, enhancing the project's maintainability and scalability. Additionally, I implemented a comprehensive suite of tests for both the frontend and the backend using Jest (for unit & integration tests) and Cypress (for e2e), ensuring robustness and reliability.

#### Open Source

🌍 I actively seek opportunities to contribute to the tech community and collaborate with like-minded individuals on exciting initiatives, which is why I really enjoy it when I can actually make meaningful contributions to open source projects.

#### Get in Touch

📬 I'm always open to connecting with fellow developers, exploring new collaborations, or discussing anything related to technology. Please feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:phpmvk@gmail.com).
